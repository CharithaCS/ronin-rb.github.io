title: New Year, new domain

We have made it to 2021. To celebrate the new year and new possibilities,
I've decided to "rebrand" Ronin and rename it's domain, GitHub Org, etc.

* Domain: [ronin-rb.dev](https://ronin-rb.dev)
* GitHub Org: [ronin-rb](https://github.com/ronin-rb)

Not only is this easier to type than "ronin_ruby", it helps differentiate the
project from other projects that also use the Ronin name.
