Are you a Python developer interested in Ruby? Are you tired of writing the
same old code over and over again in Python or with Pwnlib? Interested in what
Ruby or Ronin can do? Well two new quick reference guides were added to the
[Porting][porting] section to help you out:

* [Porting Python to Ronin Quick Ref](/docs/porting/python-to-ronin-quick-ref/)
* [Porting Pwnlib to Ronin Quick Ref](/docs/porting/pwnlib-to-ronin-quick-ref/)
