Ronin is now accepting donations on [Patreon].

I figured that many people probably already have a [Patreon
account][patreon-signup] and might not want to sign-up for
[Open Collective][opencollective-signup] just to donate to Ronin,
so I also created a [Patreon page for Ronin][Patreon]. You can choose from
the following donation tiers:

* [$1 / month][patreon-membership]
* [$5 / month][patreon-membership]
* [$10 / month][patreon-membership]
* [$20 / month][patreon-membership]

Now you can donate via [GitHub], via [Patreon], or directly via
[Open Collective]. Help support a Free and Open Source Ruby Security project
and donate today!
