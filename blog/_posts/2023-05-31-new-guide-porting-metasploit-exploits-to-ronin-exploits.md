Ever wondered how to port an existing Metasploit exploit to [Ronin
exploits][ronin-exploits]? Well, now there's a new guide for that:

[Porting Metasploit Exploits to Ronin Exploits]

This guide will cover each part of a Metasploit Exploit and show what the
[ronin-exploits] equivalent looks like.

## What is ronin-exploits?

[ronin-exploits] is a Ruby micro-framework for writing and running exploits.
ronin-exploits allows one to write exploits as plain old Ruby classes.
ronin-exploits can be distributed as Ruby files or as git repositories that can
be installed using [ronin-repos].

**tl;dr** It's like a simpler and more modular version of
[Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/).
